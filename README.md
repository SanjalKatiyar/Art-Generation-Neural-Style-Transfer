# Art-Generation-Neural-Style-Transfer
This project uses a pretrained model that can be downloaded at the following link: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/.
Here novel artistic image is generated using an algorithm. 
Most of the algorithms optimize a cost function to get a set of 
parameter values but here cost function is optimized to get pixel values.
It merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) 
and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). 
The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C 
with the "style" of image S, this is known as Neural Style Transfer.
